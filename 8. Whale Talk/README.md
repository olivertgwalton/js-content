# 🐋 Challenge 8: Whale Talk

## Objective

Create a program that translates human text into "whale talk" by extracting and transforming vowels according to whale language rules.

## Learning Goals

- Practice using loops to iterate through strings
- Work with string and array methods
- Develop problem solving skills

## Success Criteria

It doesn't matter how you solve this challenge. The tests only check the output, so the solution is up to you! Your solution should match this criteria:

- Function correctly identifies vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
- Consonants and 'y' are ignored
- Vowels 'e' and 'u' are doubled
- Output is in uppercase
- All test cases pass
